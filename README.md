# Food Image Classifier

Welcome to our Food Image Classifier project! üç≤üì∏

## Overview

We, a collaborative team consisting of [Your Name], Noshen Atashe, Soumia, and Jushwin Jagdev, proudly present an innovative Image Classifier machine learning model. The primary objective of our project is to categorize food images into three distinct categories using the Food101 Dataset.

## Project Components

### 1. Model Development

We utilized the following technologies and tools for developing our robust image classifier:

- **Google Colab:** Leveraging the power of cloud-based Jupyter notebooks for collaborative coding and GPU support.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for building the model.
- **PyTorch:** Employed for creating and training the machine learning model.

### 2. Deployment Simulation

To simulate the deployment of our model, we incorporated the following components:

- **Flask:** Used to create an example app server capable of handling REST API calls.
- **Postman:** Facilitated the execution of REST API calls for testing and validation purposes.

## Getting Started

To explore our project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Code:**
   Dive into the codebase to understand our implementation. Key files include:
   - `model_training.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for model development.
   - `app_server.py`: Flask application handling REST API calls.
